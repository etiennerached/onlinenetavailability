# onlinenetavailability
A PHP Script that will auto check the availability of online.net stock servers and send an email once a server is available. 
 
How To Use: 
1- Open the file and configure the "configuration" section 
2- Setup a cron job to execute the script. I use 1 minute cron job 
3- Make sure the emails are not landing in spam!
